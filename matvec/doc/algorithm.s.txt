The below pseudocode performs the desired sparse matrix, dense vector multiplication; for each row in the matrix, we perform the dot product of the non-zero elements of that row, and the corresponding elements of the vector, before writing this value to the result.

for row in range(m):
  result[row] = 0
  for entry in range(rowptr[row], rowptr[row + 1]):
    result[row] += values[entry] * vector[col_ind[entry]]
